Welcome to Bomblebees!
Let's learn how to control your Bomblebee before you fight other players.

[title=swap_begin] 
Nice work. You also need to know how to <color=#1FB7EF>swap tiles</color>.
The map is made of hexagonal tiles that you may swap with your <color=#1FB7EF>current held hexagonal tile.</color>  
You can swap this tile with one on the map by walking over a tile and <color=#1FB7EF>pressing SPACE</color>.
If you make a <color=#1FB7EF>straight line with 3 of the same color</color>, you make a combo!
<color="yellow">Swap with SPACE and make 5 combos to continue.</color>

[title=place_begin] 
Good job! Making combos gives you <color=#1FB7EF>bombs of that color</color>.
Bombs go into your inventory, and you can select the bomb you want with \n<color=#1FB7EF>Q and E</color> or <color=#1FB7EF>numbers 1-4</color>.
After you have selected a bomb, you can <color=#1FB7EF>place</color> it with <color=#1FB7EF>J</color>.
<color="yellow">Select your bomb using Q and E (or 1-4). Place 5 bombs with the J key to continue.</color>

POINTS and BOMBS highlight

[title=spin_begin] 
Now that you have placed some bombs on the board, you should <color=#1FB7EF>aim</color> and <color=#1FB7EF>activate</color> them.
To <color=#1FB7EF>aim</color> a bomb, stand behind it to aim it in the <color=#1FB7EF>opposite direction.</color>
Then, to <color=#1FB7EF>activate</color> a bomb, stand next to it and <color=#1FB7EF>spin with the K key.</color>
<color="yellow">Spin 3 bombs with the K key to continue.</color>
[title=spin_end]

[title=charge_begin]
You can also <color=#1FB7EF>charge</color> your spin by <color=#1FB7EF>holding K</color> to increase the power of your spin!
Charged spins hit Bombs further, buts this only applies to the <color="red">Bomble</color> and <color="yellow">Honey</color> bombs.
<color="yellow">Spin charge 3 bombs by holding the K key and releasing it at maximum power to continue.</color>

[title=points_begin]
Nice job! Finally, lets talk about <color=#1FB7EF>points</color>.
In addition to giving you Bombs, making combos earns you points. In actual matches, points are also awarded for defeating enemies.
<color="yellow">Earn 20 points from making combos to complete your training!</color>
