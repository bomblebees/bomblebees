[title=swap_begin] 
Nice work. You will also need to know how to <color=#1FB7EF>swap</color>.
The map is made of different hexagonal tiles that you may swap with. This shows your <color=#1FB7EF>current held hexagonal tile.</color>
You can swap this tile with one on the map by walking over a tile and <color=#1FB7EF>pressing space</color>.
If you make a <color=#1FB7EF>straight line with three of the same color</color>, you make a combo!
<color="yellow">Swap with space and make 5 combos to continue.</color>

[title=place_begin] 
Good job! Making combos gives you <color=#1FB7EF>points</color> and <color=#1FB7EF>bombs</color>.
This shows how many bombs are in your arsenal. Select the bomb you want to use by pressing \n<color=#1FB7EF>Q and E or numbers 1-4.</color>
After you have selected a bomb, you can <color=#1FB7EF>place</color> them on the board.
<color="yellow">Place 5 bombs with the J key to continue. Select your bomb using Q and E (or 1-4).</color>

[title=spin_begin] 
Now that you have placed some bombs on the board, you should <color=#1FB7EF>aim</color> and <color=#1FB7EF>activate</color> them to attack.
To <color=#1FB7EF>aim</color> a bomb, stand behind it to aim it in the <color=#1FB7EF>opposite direction.</color>
Then, to <color=#1FB7EF>activate</color> a bomb, stand next to it and <color=#1FB7EF>spin with the K key.</color>
<color="yellow">Spin 3 bombs with the K key to continue.</color>
[title=spin_end]

[title=charge_begin]
You can also <color=#1FB7EF>charge</color> your spin by <color=#1FB7EF>holding K</color> to increase the power of your spin!
However, this only applies to the <color="red">Bomble (red)</color> and <color="yellow">Honey (yellow)</color> bombs.
<color="yellow">Spin charge 3 bombs by holding the K key and releasing it at maximum power to continue.</color>
